## DAY 1：
1.LeetCode 26 : I'm confused what is In situ sorting? Even if I looked up the answer in baike.

2.LeetCode 189 :  The first idea is use two layers of circulation, the variable of first layer of circulation  is numbers of times K, next    ,the variable is  length of array;  Time complexity is O(k*n),space complexity is O(1);To be exact, time complexity is O(n* k%=n) ;
   Code review by refer to others , three of inversion ,the code is very clean , what's more the time complexity  is getting      shorter,O(n),exactly , O(2n).

3.LeetCode 21: I can understand the way of solving problem, but don't understand why use a temporiry variable to next pointer? 
## DAY 2:
4.LeetCode 88 : At first, i can think of two ways to do it. 
      One: Add the second array directly to the first array, and then sort it; (time complexity is O(n+nlogn) , space complexity is O(1) )
      Two:  Before and after thoughts, compare the size of the preceding element int two arrays, the smaller element plus(+1)
      Three: It's the opposite of the last one. After and before thoughts. Operate directly within large array.
      
5.LeetCode 24: It's a little hard.Especially, recursive solution.

6.LeetCode 242： Four solutions came to mind. Simple but fun.
   
7.LeetCode 49: First thought use Map to solve this problem. Three answers came up.
